Initially I figured we would have a passenger & airline class. Airline would have a single member which is a arraylist implementation of a queue of passengers which simulates the line before the check in gate and the passenger would have a name, seatt number, and class(Economy,Business, First). The airline class would also have  3 integers that represent the number of available seats in first class which has a maximum of 10 seats, 10 for business class and 20 for economy class. These numbers would be decremented respectively when a passenger is added. We will also need a checkin function that takes a name and returns a passenger. It appears we will also need some kind of graphical interface which shouldnt be too hard.
